This project contains multiple different kinds of cpu architectures. The first 
one was a simple risc core and the newer one I'm working on is a microcoded cpu.

In the src folder you will find folders corresponding to the different cpu 
types.

phoenix - the original theoretical-architecture risc core (64-bit and tons of
          registers)

iris - A simple 16 bit cpu
