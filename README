This project contains multiple different kinds of cpu architectures. The first 
one was a simple risc core and the newer one I'm working on is a microcoded cpu.

In the src folder you will find folders corresponding to the different cpu 
types.

phoenix - the original theoretical-architecture risc core (64-bit and tons of
          registers)
iris - A simple 8 bit cpu

The following are obsolete cores that I have left but have no intention of
continuing.

microcode - a cpu where the majority of the code is written in electron/clips.
polymer - a more expert system based processor which abstracts the gpu to a 
          byte stream
