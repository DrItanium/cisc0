This project contains multiple different kinds of cpu architectures. The first 
one was a simple risc core and the newer one I'm working on is a microcoded cpu.

In the src folder you will find folders corresponding to the different cpu 
types.

risc - the original theoretical-architecture risc core
microcode - a cpu where the majority of the code is written in electron/clips.
