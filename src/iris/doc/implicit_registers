The iris core features 256 8-bit implicit register slots which are used to make
it possible to provide more complex instructions without introducing extra
special registers or messing with the instruction encoding to provide more
space. 

Currently, there are only two implicit register slots being used:

0: Implicit predicate register. This is used when performing a jump and link 
   with an immediate value. Since there is not enough room for the two 
   registers plus the immediate, we cheat and use the implicit slot (which 
   defaults to r255).
1: Stack pointer. With the introduction of the separate stack memory the use of
   a stack pointer became an obvious thing. Instead of having a separate stack
   register, it was decided to repurpose one of the existing 256 for this task.
   Use of the push and pop instructions will manipulate this register as part
   of the operation. By default the stack pointer is bound to r254.
