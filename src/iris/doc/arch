The iris core is a simple 8-bit processor which has 16-bit instructions.

Some stats:

- 8 general purpose 8-bit registers
- CISC design (with influence taken from itanium, x86, and RISC designs)
- Instructions are fixed at 16-bits in length
- 64k of memory
- Simple decoder logic
- Easy to extend due to 4 unused execution groups



The general format of the instructions are as follows:

bits 13-15 : operation group [3 bits]
bits 0-12 : operation bits [13 bits]

Iris has support for up to eight instruction groups where only four are
actually in use. The four modes are:

0: Arithmetic
1: Move
2: Jump
3: Compare
4-7: Undefined (will cause a panic in the simulator at this point in time)

The operation bits are different for each major operation group.

For arithmetic operations the format is as follows:

bits 9-12 : specific operation
bits 6-8 : destination register
bits 3-5 : first source register
bits 0-2 : second source register

The list of arithmetic operations are as follows:

0 add
1 subtract
2 multiply 
3 divide
4 remainder (aka mod)
5 shift left
6 shift right
7 binary and
8 binary or
9 binary not (second source register isn't used, same form though)
10 binary xor
11-15 will cause a panic in the simulator as they are currently undefined
