The iris lisp language is a very simple wrapper over the iris architecture, it
contains very few of the features normally seen inside of a LISP language. This
is done to make the language a translation language instead of a full
programming language which defines its own abstract machine to program against.


The abstract machine already exists and doesn't need to be reimplemented.
