LockStepMachine type 0

A system consisting of 1 iris20 core and 4 iris16 secondary cores. As the
title of the machine states, it is a system which executes all of its cores in
a lock step fashion per "cycle". 

The iris20 core is a 64-bit RISC/CISC cpu with 64 registers and 67108864
(0x4000000) words (64 megawords) worth of RAM. Each word in this core is 64-bits signed. 
This translate to 512 megabytes worth of ram. Each iris20 word can contain 1
(64-bit molecule) or 2 (32-bit atom) instructions. It will execute 4
instructions before yielding clock time to the other 4 cores (each of them
getting 4 cycles each). 

Communication between these cores is facilitated via memory mapped addresses.
In the case of iris20 the following memory map exists:
