LockStepMachine type 0
======================

The LockStepMachine type0 or +lsm0+ is a system consisting of 1 iris20 core and
4 iris16 secondary cores. As the title of the machine states, it is a system
which executes all of its cores in a lock step fashion per "cycle". 

The iris20 core is a 64-bit RISC/CISC cpu with 64 registers and 64 megawords
worth of RAM. Each word in this core is 64-bits signed.  This translate to 512
megabytes worth of ram. Each iris20 word can contain 1 (64-bit molecule) or 2
(32-bit atom) instructions. It will execute 4 instructions before yielding
clock time to the other 4 cores (each of them getting 4 cycles each). 

Communication between these cores is facilitated via memory mapped addresses.
In the case of iris20 the following memory map exists:
