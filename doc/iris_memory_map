This is a basic idea of how an iris cpu would be able to reference it's
different memory spaces in a single layout. All addresses are 16-bit based
instead of 8-bit

0x00000-0x1FFFF : Code Section (32-bit words)
0x20000-0x2FFFF : Data Section
0x30000-0x3FFFF : Stack Section
0x40000-0x4FFFF : IO Section
0x50000-0xFFFFF : Unmapped

If we add the GPU into the mix then we need to add the following:

0x50000-0x5FFFF : GPU Memory (R, G, B, I)
0x60000-0xFFFFF : Unmapped
